## Objective
The task image contains ${frames} frame(s).

Return a single JSON object that contains:
1) One-sentence visual description of each frame
2) Relationships between frames
3) The overall task objective (generic, does not reveal the answer)

## Guidelines
1. Output MUST be valid JSON. Do not wrap it in markdown fences. Do not include any other text.
2. JSON schema:
   {
     "descriptions": ["..."],              // length = ${frames}
     "relations": [
       {"from": 0, "to": 1, "relationship": "..."},
       {"from": 0, "to": null, "relationship": "..."}
     ],
     "objective": "..."
   }
3. `descriptions[i]` must correspond to Frame i.
4. `objective` must be generic enough and must not reveal the concrete answer.
5. When describing the objective, use atomic verbs like "click", "slide", "drag", "draw", and refer to choices/states rather than hidden answer objects.
